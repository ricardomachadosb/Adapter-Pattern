Factory Pattern with JAVA
========

What is Factory
----
* Allows 2 incompatible interfaces to work together
* Used when the client expects a (target) interface
* The Adapter class allows the use of the available interface and the Target interface
* Any class can work together as long as the Adapter solves the issue that all classes must implement every method defined by the shared interface
